**PiClock on an LCD Screen**

Simple program using guizero library, to display a clock on an LCD screen attached to a Raspberry Pi.  I created a 
desktop launcher in LXCD window manager, and set LXCD to launch it at startup. I setup NTPd to keep the time in sync.

I created this because I wanted a large clock I could read from across the room.  With a spare 21" LCD and a Raspberry 
Pi I was able to create this simple program to display the time.  The TODO's in the code are ideas for expansion projects
that could make this better.
